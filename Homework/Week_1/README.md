Notably, Kraken has not had any major hacking events in its 10-year history, which even the international industry mainstay Binance cannot claim." (Birken & Schmidt, 2021)

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
    * Kraken Crypto offers one of the safest if not the safest storage for crypto in the industry, "Not only does Kraken offer safe coin storage, with 95% of deposits held offline in cold storage units spread across the world, but it also promises platform security: Its servers are kept in secure cages under 24/7 surveillance by armed guards and video monitors. In addition to physical security measures, Kraken encrypts all of your sensitive contact information at the system and data level and regularly engages in vulnerability testing of its own system." (Birken & Schmidt, 2021)

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
    * Kraken Crypto is currently one of the world's largest, most successful crypto exchange with over 7 million clients.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    * Though Kraken have higher fees associated with trading, it's security features gives Kraken a strong foothold in the industry.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    * Kraken already offers a variety of advance investing options such as margin trading and staking coins at Kraken. Therefore in my opinion Kraken should find a way to lower their transactional fees to gain more market share.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    * By lowering their transactional fees along with keeping all the current securities, features, and ease of use, Kraken would gain even more users than they currently have.
 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    * Krakens highest cost most likely comes from the offline cold storage with high security, plus the encription of contact info. If there is a way to automate the security features, robot security guards etc., I believe they could cut cost dramatically.
